<P >Applying
    for online finance
</P>

<P >Applying
    for online finance couldn't be easier or more convenient. When you
    buy online from &lt;Company Name&gt;

    you have the choice of applying for finance by
    adding your purchase to the shopping basket, selecting the finance
    option on the checkout page, and completing an online application
    form. Just follow the simple instructions, entering your personal
    details as required and we'll do the rest.</P>

<P >The
    whole process only takes a few minutes and is simple and secure. Once
    your finance application is approved, you will then be advised of how
    to sign the finance agreement and you will also receive an email
    confirming these details. Please read the agreement carefully
    checking that all the details are correct, then either e-sign the
    agreement or print and sign the agreement twice. Post the signed
    agreement to the address shown on the covering letter of the
    agreement.</P>

<P >Following
    receipt of your finance agreement and a few additional checks, your
    goods will be dispatched.</P>

<H3>Your questions answered</H3>

<P >Here's
    some of the most commonly asked questions regarding online finance.</P>

<H3>Once my application is approved,
    what happens next?</H3>

<P >Within
    minutes of your application being approved, you will be presented
    with the options to either e-sign or print and return your finance
    agreement. If you choose to e-sign your agreement, a PDF of your
    agreement will be displayed on screen. You should read the agreement
    carefully before clicking all the relevant sections agreeing to its
    terms. Once you have agreed to the terms of the finance agreement
    &lt;Company Name&gt;
    will
    be notified and you need do nothing more. If you choose to print and
    return your agreement you should print the agreement, read it

    the covering letter. This signed document should then be posted to

<P >Note
    that products will not be allocated to your order until your
    completed and signed agreement is returned and received by Hitachi
    Personal Finance. Shipment of your goods will follow soon after your
    agreement has been returned and received.</P>

<H3>Will your credit score me and if so,
    what does this mean?</H3>

<P >Credit
    scoring is the process used by financial services companies to
    evaluate the credit risk of new applicants. This technique will be
    applied to your application for online finance. Credit scoring works
    by awarding points for each answer given on the application form such
    as age, income and occupation, together with information obtained
    from credit reference agencies. This information allows us to produce
    consistent decisions, ensuring all our applicants are treated fairly.
    Credit scoring does not discriminate on the grounds of sex, race,
    religion or disability.</P>

<H3>If you decline my application, what
    is the reason?</H3>

<P >In
    addition to credit scoring, we also take into account confirmation of
    your identity, validation of certain application details, existing
    commitments and information held at the credit reference agencies.
    Though we are unable to provide you with a main reason for decline of
    your application, it is usually based on one, or a combination of the
    following:</P>
<UL>
    <LI>Your credit score
        (note that every finance company will score you differently)
    <LI>Adverse credit
        reference agency information
    <LI>You are considered
        to be overcommitted
    <LI>You are aged under
        18
    <LI>Your existing
        account performance with other lenders
</UL>
<H3>What type of information do credit
    reference agencies hold about me?</H3>

<P >Some of
    the information is public information, for example electoral roll,
    County Court Judgements and bankruptcies. Other lenders may also file
    information about accounts you hold with them for instance this could
    include your payment history and outstanding balance on these
    accounts. Any requests for credit, where a credit reference search
    has been undertaken, will also be filed, although the result of the
    request is not recorded.</P>

<H3>How do I obtain a copy of this
    information?</H3>

<P >You
    should send a cheque for £2.00 made payable to the relevant credit
    reference agency, together with details of all addresses at which you
    have lived over the last 6 years:</P>
<UL>
    <LI>Experian Limited,
        Customer Support Centre, PO Box 9000, Nottingham, NG80 7WF
    <LI>Equifax Ltd.,
        Customer Service Centre, PO Box 10036, Leicester, LE3 4FS
    <LI>Callcredit
        Limited, Consumer Services, PO Box 491, Leeds, LS3 1WZ
</UL>
<P >The
    above listed agencies will provide details of information relating to
    these addresses. If you believe that the information is incorrect,
    you can ask the agency to correct it.</P>

<H3>If my application is not successful,
    can I re-apply?</H3>

<P >Yes. We
    acknowledge that your circumstances change and just because we have
    refused a previous application, it does not mean that we'll
    automatically turn down a further request. We do suggest however,
    that you leave at least 6 months between applications.</P>

<H3>Can I request delivery to an address
    other than my home?</H3>

<P >In
    order to safeguard against fraudulent applications, we regret that
    we're able only to deliver goods to the home address of the
    applicant.&nbsp;</P>
